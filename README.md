# Pymolia Analysis
For my first project in Pandas, I created a series of tables from queries on a fictional video game, "Pymolia". Looking back at the project, it was the first time I had been able to query data in such a clear way and apply aggregations and calculations from the outset. However, if I were to redo it, I would apply tricks like list comprehension to turn some of my copy/pasted blocks creating columns or aggregating sums to list comprehension functions, applying the same feature automatically instead.
